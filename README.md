# Frozen Lake
The "Reinforcement Learning for Frozen Lake Navigation" project is an exciting and practical application of machine learning, specifically reinforcement learning, to tackle the challenge of navigating a simulated frozen lake environment. This project will leverage the FrozenLake environment, a classic problem in the field of reinforcement learning, to develop and train intelligent agents capable of making optimal decisions on ice navigation.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a reinforcement learning algorithm that allows an agent to learn and navigate a frozen lake environment effectively. \
